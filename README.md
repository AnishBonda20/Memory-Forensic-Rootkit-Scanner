# Memory Forensic Rootkit Scanner 🧠🔍

### Overview
This project focuses on detecting rootkits and hidden processes through memory forensics.  
Memory dumps were captured using **DumpIt** and analyzed using **Volatility** to identify **hidden processes** and **SSDT hooks** — indicators of rootkit activity.

---

### 🧩 Objectives
- Capture live memory for forensic analysis  
- Detect hidden processes and malicious kernel hooks  
- Demonstrate how memory analysis aids rootkit detection

### 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- **DumpIt** – For capturing physical memory
- **Volatility Framework** – For memory analysis
- **Python** – For automating report generation and anomaly detection
- **Windows** – Test environment
